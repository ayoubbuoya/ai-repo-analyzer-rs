## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayoubbuoya/ai-repo-analyzer-rs.git
cd ai-repo-analyzer-rs
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze a repository
./target/release/ai-repo-analyzer-rs https://github.com/owner/repo

# With GitHub token for higher API limits
./target/release/ai-repo-analyzer-rs https://github.com/owner/repo --token ghp_your_token_here

# Export to JSON file
./target/release/ai-repo-analyzer-rs https://github.com/owner/repo --output json --output-file analysis.json

# Export to YAML file
./target/release/ai-repo-analyzer-rs https://github.com/owner/repo --output yaml --output-file analysis.yaml
```

### Environment Variables

You can set your GitHub token as an environment variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
./target/release/ai-repo-analyzer-rs https://github.com/owner/repo
```

### Command Line Options

- `--token <token>`: GitHub personal access token for API authentication
- `--output <format>`: Output format (json or yaml, default: json)
- `--output-file <path>`: Save analysis to file instead of stdout

## Output Format

The analyzer produces a comprehensive JSON/YAML output containing:

## GitHub Token Setup

For higher API rate limits and access to private repositories, set up a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope for private repos or `public_repo` for public repos
3. Use the token with the `--token` flag or `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable

AI Repo Analyzer (ai-repo-analyzer-rs) is a Rust-based AI agent that helps developers
explore and understand GitHub repositories efficiently.

Features:

- Clones and parses source files from a repository
- Splits large files into manageable chunks with semantic context
- Generates embeddings for each chunk and stores them in Qdrant
- Supports natural-language queries over the repository
- Retrieves, re-ranks, and stitches relevant code chunks
- Provides clear, human-readable explanations of code

Tech Stack:

- Rust
- Rig (AI agent orchestration)
- Qdrant (vector database)
